This is alpha code.  As such it is far from perfect.

Known issues:

1. Video is badly shot. Needs to be replaced.

2. When you enter the store at high speed, the mother fussing
over the kid fusses very fast.

3. Logs are very verbose.  The code is still being debugged
and this will continue until the reliability gets better.

Known limitation:

1. The software does not precisely the LARY 1201 on which it is 
based.  If you want to fix that then feel free to edit the many 
tuning parameters in this code and send them to me.

2. Uphill and downhill are not implemented.

3. Zorch sound is not authentic.  But the real one is to subtle for 
this video game.

Know bugs:

1. The video will glitch on startup and show strange colors.

2. When an error occurs, the video does not rewind to the start properly.

3. Tons of vlc error get printed when running this on linux.  And I have no
idea (yet) what to do about them.
