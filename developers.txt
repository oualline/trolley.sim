For developers
==============

This code is released under the GPL which means you can
view the source code and modify it.  The only restriction
is that if you do improve it and distribute the improvements
you must distribute the source code too.

You should have a working knowledge of Python and QT4 to
work on this code.

Github
======

The program is hosted on Github at: https://github.com/oualline/trolley.sim.git

Log File
========

The log file is in /tmp/trolley.log (Linux) or 
$TEMP\trolley.log on Windows.   You must set TEMP on
Windows to get the log file.  It contains a ton of 
information about what's going on with the program.

Internals
=========

Position is the position in the media file.  It is a number 
from 0.0 to 1.0.  Speed is measure as playback speed with 1.0
being normal speed.  (The speed of a fairly slow trolley.)

User Interface
==============

The user interface responds to the following keyboard 
commands:

"m" -- Write a "mark" message to the log.  This is so we 
can figure out where to locate events along the line.

The keys "0"-"8" will move the throttle to the indicated run position 
without letting the program know the throttle was moved.  This was done
to debug the throttle movement.

Adding your own video
=====================

If you wish to add your own video feel free to do so.  We request that you 
do so by adding a new mode to the list so that your change is generic.

If you wish help adding your video to the program feel free to contact the author,
Steve Oualline   oualline@gmail.com.   

We ask that you keep the SCRM logo on any version you make as the original author 
is a SCRM volunteer.

Selling the software
====================

The software is licensed under the GPL.  That doesn't mean that you can't create
your own version and sell a USB key with the software on it.  However, if you do so
you must make available the source code the anyone who requests it.  (Or better yet feed you
changes back to the original author as a "pull request")

The purpose of this project was to make a high quality trolley simulator available to any
institution that wants it.  I hope you find this beneficial.
